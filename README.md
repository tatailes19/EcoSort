# EcoSort : Automating waste Detection and Sorting using Computer Vision and waste managemnt with data analysis


## Project Overview

This project leverages computer vision to revolutionize waste management by detecting, sorting, and filtering waste using a smart trash bin. The system improves waste management processes through real-time object detection and provides actionable insights via a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizes a computer vision model to identify and classify different types of waste in real-time.
- **Automated Sorting:** Sorts waste based on its category to enhance recycling and disposal efficiency.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzes waste data to optimize waste management processes and contribute to a more sustainable future.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides a visual representation of waste data, including sorting statistics and real-time monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once), custom model
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Data Management:** pandas, NumPy
